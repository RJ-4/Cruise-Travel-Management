# Cruise-Travel-Management
An online reservation system developed using C++ which records passengerâ€™s travelling as well as personal details and generates the total bill. A unique booking code is allotted to each customer allowing them to view, modify or cancel their reservation.

Software required: C++ compiler

Note: I don't own or claim to be the original developer of this program. This is just something I dicovered on web an found interesting so I decided to study it and make some modifications. Original source can be found at: http://lakshaycoding.blogspot.com/2014/05/cruise-travel-management.html
